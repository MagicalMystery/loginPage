\f0\fs24 \cf0 I have used simple HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript concepts.\
The login page has email and password. Upon validation, the user can successfully sign in. I have not implemented the form clear feature when cancel button is pressed as it requires some back end coding.\
An option to sign in is also provided where I have used an animation feature to overlap a div on another on the click of the button. The user has to enter some details and successfully get signed in or press the cancel button and come back to the login page.\
I had hosted the page using Node.js. }
